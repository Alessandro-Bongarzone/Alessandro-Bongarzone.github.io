_The world little knows how many of the thoughts and theories which have passed through the mind of a scientific investigator, have been crushed in silence and secrecy by his own severe criticism and adverse examination._

Welcome to my webpage!

![Editing a markdown file for a talk](/images/COVER_BANNER_3-min.jpg)

I have recently completed my PhD in [Mechanics](https://www.epfl.ch/education/phd/edme-mechanics/) at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/) under the supervision of Prof. François Gallaire, head of the [Laboratory of Fluid Mechanics and Instabilities](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lfmi). 

During my PhD, I have mostly worked on the theoretical modelling of **[self-sustained dynamics and forced resonant oscillations](http://Alessandro-Bongarzone.github.io/files/Abstract_PhD.pdf)** in various flow problems ranging from [cross-junction jets](https://alessandro-bongarzone.github.io/research/) to [liquids sloshing](https://alessandro-bongarzone.github.io/research/).

Specifically, I use **linear stability analysis** and **asymptotic techniques** to provide comprehensive theoretical frameworks based on reduced models, such as amplitude equations, that can rationalise some of these complex nonlinear oscillatory dynamics. To achieve this, my work draws upon **direct numerical simulations** and dedicated **experiments**, which have been performed and designed in collaboration with other experienced researchers.

More info will be available soon under [Research & Tutorials](https://alessandro-bongarzone.github.io/research/). 

Background
------

After obtaining my Scientific High School Diploma in 2013, I left my hometown, [Narni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narni), located in the heart of Italy, and I moved to [Pisa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pisa) for a Bachelor's Degree in Aerospace Engineering until 2016. During my Master's Degree in Aeronautical Engineering at [Università di Pisa](https://www.unipi.it), I had the pleasure of attending the course _Computational Fluid Dynamics_ (CFD) held by Prof. Simone Camarri, who quickly made me passionate about CFD. He played a significant role in my moving to [Lausanne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lausanne) in September 2018, where I first met Prof. François Gallaire, who introduced me to the fascinating field of hydrodynamics instabilities during a seven months Research Internship at [LFMI](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lfmi)-[EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/). Such a stimulating experience pushed me to join again [LFMI](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lfmi) in 2019 for a 4-years PhD in [Mechanics](https://www.epfl.ch/education/phd/edme-mechanics/), which I completed in July 2023.
