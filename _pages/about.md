![Editing a markdown file for a talk](/images/COVER_BANNER_2-min.jpg)

I have recently completed my PhD in Mechanical Engineering at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/) under the supervision of Prof. Fran√ßois Gallaire, head of the [Laboratory of Fluid Mechanics and Instabilities](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lfmi). 

Dissertation title: _**Self-sustained dynamics and forced resonant oscillations in flows: cross-junction jets and sloshing liquids**_ (here is the [Abstract](http://Alessandro-Bongarzone.github.io/files/Abstract_PhD.pdf)).


My research consists of developing reduced order models such as amplitude equations to study ... 

More detailed info about my research topics will be available soon under [Research & Tutorials](https://alessandro-bongarzone.github.io/research/).

I am also a reviewer for _[Journal of Fluid Mechanics](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-fluid-mechanics)_.

Background
------

After obtaining my Scientific High School Diploma in 2013, I left my hometown, Narni, located in the heart of Italy, and I moved to Pisa for a Bachelor's Degree in Aerospace Engineering. During my Master's Degree in Aeronautical Engineering at Universit√† di Pisa, I had the pleasure of attending the course _Computational Fluid Dynamics_ (CFD) held by Prof. Simone Camarri, who quickly made me passionate about CFD. He played a significant role in my moving to Lausanne in 2018 and in letting me meet Prof. Fran√ßois Gallaire, who introduced me to the concept of hydrodynamics stability in a seven months Master's project at LFMI-EPFL under his supervision. During this period, . 

This vision and passion brought me to my current research

and Master's Degrees in Aerospace and Aeronautical Engineering degree in 2006 at √âcole Polytechnique (Paris, France) and my M.Sc. at KTH (Stockholm, Sweden). After working three years as an automotive engineer in Aerodynamics and Thermal Management at Nissan (Japan), I completed a Ph.D. in 2014 at EPFL (Lausanne, Switzerland) under the supervision of F. Gallaire and received the ‚ÄúBest EDME Ph.D. Thesis Award‚Äù from EPFL Doctoral School of Mechanics. From 2015 to 2019 I was a Senior Scientist at ETHZ, and in 2018-2019 I was an Assistant Professor at √âcole Polytechnique.
