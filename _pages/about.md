![Editing a markdown file for a talk](/images/Fluid_Oscillations_bis.pdf)


Welcome to my personal webpage! üëã
------

I have just completed my PhD in Mechanical Engineering at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/) under the supervision of Prof. Fran√ßois Gallaire, head of the [Laboratory of Fluid Mechanics and Instabilities](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lfmi). 

Dissertation title: _**Self-sustained dynamics and forced resonant oscillations in flows: cross-junction jets and sloshing liquids**_ (here is the [Abstract](http://Alessandro-Bongarzone.github.io/files/Abstract_PhD.pdf)).


My research consists of developing reduced order models such as amplitude equations to study ... 

More detailed info about my research topics will be available soon under [Research & Tutorials](https://alessandro-bongarzone.github.io/research/).

I am also a reviewer for _[Journal of Fluid Mechanics](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-fluid-mechanics)_.
