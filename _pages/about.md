Welcome to my personal webpage!

![Editing a markdown file for a talk](/images/COVER_BANNER_3-min.jpg)

I have recently completed my PhD in [Mechanics](https://www.epfl.ch/education/phd/edme-mechanics/) at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/) under the supervision of Prof. François Gallaire, head of the [Laboratory of Fluid Mechanics and Instabilities](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lfmi). 

More info about my research will be available soon under [Research & Tutorials](https://alessandro-bongarzone.github.io/research/). 

The abstract of my Thesis, entitled _**Self-sustained dynamics and forced resonant oscillations in flows: cross-junction jets and sloshing liquids**_, is available at the following [link](http://Alessandro-Bongarzone.github.io/files/Abstract_PhD.pdf)).

I am also a reviewer for _[Journal of Fluid Mechanics](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-fluid-mechanics)_.


Background
------

After obtaining my Scientific High School Diploma in 2013, I left my hometown, [Narni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narni), located in the heart of Italy, and I moved to [Pisa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pisa) for a Bachelor's Degree in Aerospace Engineering, which I completed in 2016. During my Master's Degree in Aeronautical Engineering at [Università di Pisa](https://www.unipi.it), I had the pleasure of attending the course _Computational Fluid Dynamics_ (CFD) held by Prof. Simone Camarri, who quickly made me passionate about CFD. He played a significant role in my moving to [Lausanne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lausanne) in September 2018, where I first met Prof. François Gallaire, who introduced me to the fascinating field of hydrodynamics instabilities during a seven months Research Internship at [LFMI](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lfmi)-[EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/). Such a stimulating experience pushed me to join again [LFMI](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lfmi) in 2019 for a 4-years PhD, which I successfully completed in July 2023.
