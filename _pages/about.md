![Editing a markdown file for a talk](/images/COVER_BANNER_2-min.jpg)

I have recently completed my PhD in Mechanical Engineering at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/) under the supervision of Prof. Fran√ßois Gallaire, head of the [Laboratory of Fluid Mechanics and Instabilities](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lfmi). 

My research consists of developing reduced order models such as amplitude equations to study ... 

More info about my research topics will be available soon under [Research & Tutorials](https://alessandro-bongarzone.github.io/research/). You can read the abstract of my Thesis entitled _**Self-sustained dynamics and forced resonant oscillations in flows: cross-junction jets and sloshing liquids**_ at the following link [Abstract](http://Alessandro-Bongarzone.github.io/files/Abstract_PhD.pdf)).

I am also a reviewer for _[Journal of Fluid Mechanics](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-fluid-mechanics)_.

Background
------

After obtaining my Scientific High School Diploma in 2013, I left my hometown, [Narni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narni), located in the heart of Italy, and I moved to [Pisa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pisa) for a Bachelor's Degree in Aerospace Engineering. During my Master's Degree in Aeronautical Engineering at [Universit√† di Pisa](https://www.unipi.it), I had the pleasure of attending the course _Computational Fluid Dynamics_ (CFD) held by Prof. Simone Camarri, who quickly made me passionate about CFD. He played a significant role in my moving to Lausanne in September 2018 and in letting me meet Prof. Fran√ßois Gallaire, who first introduced me to the fascinating field of hydrodynamics instabilities during a seven months Research Internship at [Laboratory of Fluid Mechanics and Instabilities](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lfmi)-[√âcole Polytechnique F√©d√©rale de Lausanne](https://www.epfl.ch/en/). In 2019 I re-joined the members of [Laboratory of Fluid Mechanics and Instabilities](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lfmi) for a four years PhD, which I successfully completed in July 2023.
