**Caption**: _Evolution of the dye concentration fields with time in a micro-oscillator structure with three inlet channels for $Re=32$. The images are taken at regular time intervals during one oscillation (from left to right, top to bottom). The jets width is $100$ $\mu m$, the three jets are placed at an angle of $120^{\circ}$ on a circle $800$ $\mu m$ in diameter, the output channels width is $2000$ $\mu m$, and the thickness of the device is $525$ $\mu m$._
