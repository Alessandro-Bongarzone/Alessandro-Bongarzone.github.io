We investigate the response of the free liquid surface in a partially filled circular cylindrical container undergoing a planar elliptic and time-periodic orbit while maintaining fixed its orientation. For small forcing amplitudes and deep liquid layers, we quantify the effect of the orbit’s aspect ratio on the surface dynamics in the vicinity of the fluid system’s lowest natural frequency. We provide experimental evidence of the existence of a frequency range where stable swirling can be either co- or counter-directed with respect to the container’s direction of motion. Our findings are then rationalized by an inviscid weakly nonlinear model, amended with heuristic damping.

**Caption**: _Images of the fluid-free surface while the container is subjected to a longitudinal harmonic forcing of amplitude $a_x=\overline{a}_x/R\approx0.23$ at various driving angular frequencies $\Omega$ close to $\omega_2/2$. The fluid-free surface is observed in the direction aligned with the container motion. For each driving frequency (a), (b) and (c), the time interval between two snapshots is about $T/4$, with $T=2\pi/\Omega$ the corresponding oscillation period. On each snapshot, the vertical middle axis is represented by a red dotted line. For a forcing frequency $\Omega\approx0.48\omega_2$ (a) and $\Omega\approx0.52\omega_2$ (c) the free-surface image at each time t is mirror symmetric with respect to the middle vertical axis, the signature of a planar wave regime, while the symmetry is broken for $\Omega\approx0.50\omega_2$ (c) revealing a swirling wave. Results are shown for (a) $\Omega/\omega_2\approx 0.48$, (b) $\Omega/\omega_2\approx0.50$ and (c) $\Omega/\omega_2\approx0.52$._
