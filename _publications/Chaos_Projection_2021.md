We present a physics-inspired mathematical model based on successive linear eigenmode projections to solve the relaxation of small-amplitude and two-dimensional viscous capillary-gravity waves with a phenomenological nonlinear contact line model. We show that each projection eventually induces a rapid loss of total energy in the liquid motion and contributes to its nonlinear damping.

The comprehension of the role of wetting properties in the damping of liquid oscillations in confined basins is a long-standing problem in the hydrodynamics field and for which renewed inter- est has emerged in recent years. A series of careful lab-scale experiments have revealed that the damping of liquid natural small oscillations varies nonlinearly with the oscillation amplitude, in contrast with previous theoretical predictions, which prescribe a constant and unique value for the damping rate, thus indicating a dependence on the contact line behavior and hence on the solid substrate material. This effect has been tentatively attributed to a source of dissipation localized in the proximity of the air–liquid–solid triple line, which, during the dynamics, may exhibit a complex hysteretic behavior under the effect of a solid-like wall friction. In this work, assuming that the contact line behaves according to experimentally inspired phenomenological laws, we formalize a mathematical method based on successive linear eigenmode projections for solving numerically the nonlinear fluid motion in the limit of small oscillation amplitudes. This approach captures the transition from a contact line stick-slip (or nearly stick-slip) motion to a pinned (or nearly pinned) configuration, as well as the secondary fluid bulk motion following the arrest of the contact line, overlooked by previous asymptotic analyses.
